# sudoku-solver

A fun into to py project of training a python script to solve sudoku puzzles without guessing.  You can add logic onto it own your own.  If you get stuck, take a look at some more advanced techniques [here](https://www.sudokuoftheday.com/techniques/) that you could add.

The sudoku-solver.py script as-is:

* Has a class called Board
* Starts out with all 81 cells capable of any number 1-9
* Can load a starting board for testing
* Can print out a "pretty" view of the known cell values
* Can set the value of a cell to a known number
* Can remove a number as an option for a cell
* Can show any remaining options for a certain number

* Has 2 starter solution techniques
  * remove a number as an option from a row
  * remove a number as an option from a column

Enjoy!
